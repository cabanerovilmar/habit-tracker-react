He received only the amount of **P1,920** after the bank collected an advance interest of **P80.00**. What was the rate of interest that the bank collected in advance?\n\n**Choices:**\n- A. 4.00%\n- B. 4.07%\n- C. 4.17%\n- D. 4.25%\n\n**Given:**\n- Future Worth (amount to be repaid), \\( F = \\text{P} 2,000 \\)\n- Amount received (Present Worth), \\( P = \\text{P} 1,920 \\)\n- Discount, \\( D = \\text{P} 80 \\)\n\n**Required:**\n- Rate of interest, \\( i \\)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the rate of discount, \\( d \\):**\n\n   The rate of discount is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{D}{F}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute the given values into the formula:**\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{80}{2,000}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the rate of discount:**\n   \\[\n   d = 0.04\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identify the formula needed to find the rate of interest \\( i \\):**\n\n   Use the formula relating interest rate to the discount rate:\n   \\[\n   i = \\frac{d}{1 - d}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute the calculated discount rate into the formula:**\n   \\[\n   i = \\frac{0.04}{1 - 0.04}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the rate of interest:**\n   \\[\n   i = 0.0417\n   \\]\n\n7. **Convert to a percentage:**\n   \\[\n   i = 4.17\\%\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\nThe rate of interest that the bank collected in advance is **4.17%**."
