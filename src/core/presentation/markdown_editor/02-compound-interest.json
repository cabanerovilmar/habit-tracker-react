This means that interest earns interest, causing the charges to grow exponentially over time. Compound interest is commonly used in commercial settings, particularly for long-term investments or loans.\n\n**Formula for Future Amount**  \nThe future amount of the principal with compound interest can be determined using the geometric progression formula:\n\n\\[\nF = P(1 + i)^n\n\\]\n\n**Variables**  \n- \\( F = \\) future amount  \n- \\( P = \\) principal  \n- \\( i = \\) interest rate per period \n- \\( n = \\) number of compounding periods\n\n**Single Payment Compound Amount Factor**  \n\\[\n(1 + i)^n\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Compound Interest with Compounding Periods**\n\n**Description**  \nWhen the nominal rate (\\( NR \\)) is not directly equal to the interest rate per period (\\( i \\)), compounding occurs multiple times within a year. This formula calculates the future value considering the compounding frequency.\n\n**Formula**  \n\\[\nF = P \\left(1 + \\frac{NR}{m}\\right)^{mN}\n\\]\n\n**Variables**  \n- \\( F = \\) future value  \n- \\( P = \\) principal  \n- \\( NR = \\) nominal rate (annual rate)  \n- \\( m = \\) number of compounding periods per year (e.g., 4 for quarterly, 12 for monthly)  \n- \\( N = \\) time period in years\n\n**Interest Rate per Period**  \nThe interest rate per period (\\( i \\)) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\ni = \\frac{NR}{m}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Present Worth of Compound Interest**\n\n**Description**  \nPresent worth is the value today of a future amount of money, discounted back using compound interest. It reflects the current equivalent of a future sum of money based on the given interest rate and compounding frequency.\n\n**Formula for Present Worth (Standard Compounding)**  \n\\[\nP = \\frac{F}{(1 + i)^n}\n\\]\n\n**Formula for Present Worth with Compounding Periods**  \nWhen the nominal rate (\\( NR \\)) is not equal to the interest rate per period (\\( i \\)), and compounding occurs \\( m \\) times per year:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{F}{\\left(1 + \\frac{NR}{m}\\right)^{mN}}\n\\]\n\n**Variables**  \n- \\( P = \\) present worth  \n- \\( F = \\) future amount  \n- \\( i = \\) interest rate per period\n- \\( n = \\) number of compounding periods  \n- \\( NR = \\) nominal rate (annual rate)  \n- \\( m = \\) number of compounding periods per year  \n- \\( N = \\) time period in years\n\n**Single Payment Present Worth Factor**  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(1 + i)^n}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Concept of Geometric Progression in Compound Interest**\n\n**Description**  \nCompound interest calculations can be derived from the principles of geometric progression, where the total amount after each period follows the pattern:\n\n- First term: \\( a_1 = P(1 + i) \\)  \n- Second term: \\( a_2 = P(1 + i)^2 \\)  \n- Third term: \\( a_3 = P(1 + i)^3 \\)  \n- And so on.\n\n**Common Ratio**  \nThe common ratio \\( r \\) between successive terms is:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{P(1 + i)^2}{P(1 + i)} = 1 + i\n\\]\n\n**Formula for the nth Term**  \nUsing the geometric progression formula for the nth term:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 r^{n-1} = P(1 + i)(1 + i)^{n-1} = P(1 + i)^n\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Continuous Compounding**\n\n**Description**  \nContinuous compounding assumes that cash payments do not occur just once per year but that compounding is continuous throughout the year. This concept allows interest to be compounded infinitely, resulting in a more accurate representation of exponential growth over time.\n\n**Formula for Future Amount with Continuous Compounding**  \nFor continuous compounding, the future value is given by:\n\n\\[\nF = Pe^{(NR)N}\n\\]\n\n**Variables**  \n- \\( F = \\) future amount  \n- \\( P = \\) principal  \n- \\( e = \\) Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)  \n- \\( NR = \\) nominal rate (annual rate)  \n- \\( N = \\) time period in years  \n- \\( e^{(NR)N} = \\) continuous compounding amount factor\n\n---\n\n### **Derivation of Continuous Compounding Formula**\n\n**Derivation Overview**  \nThe basic formula for future worth under compound interest is:\n\n\\[\nF = P(1 + i)^n\n\\]\n\nWhen compounding occurs \\( m \\) times per year:\n\n\\[\nF = P \\left(1 + \\frac{NR}{m}\\right)^{mN}\n\\]\n\nAs \\( m \\) approaches infinity (continuous compounding):\n\n\\[\nF = P \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{x(NR)N} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad x = \\frac{m}{NR}\n\\]\n\nTaking the limit as \\( x \\to \\infty \\):\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^x = e\n\\]\n\nThus, the formula simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nF = Pe^{(NR)N}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Present Worth of Continuous Compounding**\n\n**Description**  \nThe present worth of a future amount under continuous compounding can be calculated by reversing the continuous compounding formula.\n\n**Formula for Present Worth**  \n\\[\nP = \\frac{F}{e^{(NR)N}}\n\\]\n\n**Variables**  \n- \\( P = \\) present worth  \n- \\( F = \\) future amount  \n- \\( NR = \\) nominal rate  \n- \\( N = \\) time period in years  \n- \\( e^{(NR)N} = \\) continuous compounding amount factor\n\n---\n\n### **Types of Interest Rates**\n\n**Description**  \nInterest rates represent the cost of borrowing money or the earnings on an investment. The main types of interest rates are:\n\n1. **Nominal Rate of Interest (NR):**  \n   This is the stated or basic annual interest rate without considering the effects of compounding within the year.\n\n2. **Effective Rate of Interest (ER):**  \n   The effective rate represents the true rate of interest earned or paid in a year after accounting for the compounding frequency. The more frequently interest is compounded, the higher the effective rate compared to the nominal rate.\n\n**Example**  \nIf an investment has a nominal rate of 5% compounded quarterly, the nominal rate (NR) is 5%, but because of the quarterly compounding, the effective rate (ER) will be greater than 5%.\n\n---\n\n### **Formula for Effective Rate of Interest**\n\n**Formula**  \nThe effective rate of interest (ER) is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nER = \\left(1 + \\frac{NR}{m}\\right)^m - 1\n\\]\n\n**Variables**  \n- \\( ER = \\) effective rate of interest  \n- \\( NR = \\) nominal rate of interest  \n- \\( m = \\) number of compounding periods per year (e.g., 4 for quarterly, 12 for monthly)  \n- \\( i = \\) interest rate per period, calculated as \\( i = \\frac{NR}{m} \\)\n\n**Special Cases**  \n- If compounding is annual (\\( m = 1 \\)), then \\( i = NR \\), and the effective rate equals the nominal rate.\n\n**Note**  \nThe effective rate increases with the frequency of compounding because each compounding period allows interest to earn additional interest, enhancing the total earnings or cost over time.\n"
